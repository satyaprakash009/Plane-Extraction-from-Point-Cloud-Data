### CMakeLists.txt Configuration

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(PointCloudProcessing)

# Find and include Open3D
find_package(Open3D REQUIRED)
include_directories(${Open3D_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# Find and include Eigen
find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
include_directories(${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR})

# Set C++ standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)

# Add the executable
add_executable(PointCloudProcessing main.cpp)

# Link libraries
target_link_libraries(PointCloudProcessing ${Open3D_LIBRARIES} Eigen3::Eigen)
```

### Requirements Overview

- **Open3D**: A library that supports 3D data processing (e.g., point cloud processing).
- **Eigen**: A C++ template library for linear algebra, used for handling matrices and vectors.

### Dependencies to Install

- **Open3D**: 
  - Open3D should be built and installed on your system. You can use CMake to manage the build process.
  - Instructions to install Open3D: [Open3D Installation Guide](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/compilation.html)

- **Eigen**: 
  - Eigen can be downloaded or installed through a package manager like `apt` for Ubuntu.
  - Example command for Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev`

### Example `requirements.txt` in Plain Text

For C++ projects, you typically have a `CMakeLists.txt` instead of a `requirements.txt` as in Python. However, the `requirements.txt` would conceptually include:

```
Eigen >= 3.3
Open3D >= 0.14.1
```

### Installation Instructions

1. **Clone Open3D**: `git clone https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D`
2. **Build Open3D**: Follow the instructions in the Open3D documentation.
3. **Install Eigen**: If not already installed, you can install Eigen via a package manager.

After setting up these dependencies, you should be able to compile and run the C++ code using CMake.
